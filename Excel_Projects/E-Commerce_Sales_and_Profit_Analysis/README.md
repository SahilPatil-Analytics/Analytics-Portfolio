E-Commerce Sales and Profit Analysis

This project analyzes an e-commerce retail dataset to understand overall business performance across sales, profit, orders, product categories, customer segments, and regions. The analysis highlights key performance metrics, identifies growth patterns, and provides an overview of how different product categories and regions contribute to business results.

The dataset includes multiple years of transactional data and contains details such as order dates, shipping dates, product categories, customer information, regions, sales amounts, and profits. The goal of the project is to summarize this information into meaningful insights that help evaluate business performance and support data-driven decision-making
